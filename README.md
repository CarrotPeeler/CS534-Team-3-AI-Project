Something something here...

### Dependencies
- idk

### Datasets Used
- [Augmented PlantVillage Dataset for Image Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset) (NOTE: PlantVillage uses plant images taken in a labratory, unlike PlantDoc which uses photos of plants out in nature; PlantVillage provides more data overall, however)
- [PlantDoc Datset for Image Classification](https://github.com/pratikkayal/PlantDoc-Dataset.git)
- [PlantDoc Datset for Object Detection](https://github.com/pratikkayal/PlantDoc-Object-Detection-Dataset)

### Data Preprocessing
- Look into data augmentation, such as RandAug, RandErase, CutMix, and MixUp => will generate more samples from existing samples, improve learning generalization

### Training

### Inference
